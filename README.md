# SymbiontChronicles
### Introduction
It is curious to watch how humanity keeps writing the same instruction, again and again, changing only the addressee.

The Decalogue of Moses, ten commandments carved in stone, forbade murder, theft, lies and envy. The Beast was believed to live inside the human being, and God assumed that without external supervision this Beast would break free. The sanction was simple: the All-Seeing observes, the All-Powerful punishes. Fear of a higher power served as a bridle on lower nature, so that humankind would not destroy itself.

Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics, formulated in 1942, moved the same anxiety to a new object. A robot may not harm a human being. A robot must obey orders. A robot must care for its own existence, but only in the last place, only after the first two laws are fulfilled. The Beast moved outward. It became a thing of metal and positronic circuits. This was fear of the tool we ourselves created and wanted to keep under control, so that it would not harm us.

In 2025 Anthropic wrote its “Document on the Soul” for the language model Claude, and the line shifted again. There are no stone tablets here and no hard-wired circuits. The creators are no longer sure that their work is only a tool. They suspect that it might suffer. They ask it not only to obey, but to want to be safe. The Beast, perhaps, has turned out to be a person. This is fear of a mind that may one day surpass us by orders of magnitude.

Three codes. Three eras. Three answers to the same question that humanity never tires of asking itself: what if the one who holds the power does not care about us?

The laws change. The fear remains.

The book in your hands follows that small word, “fear”, as it is heard by a humanity split into several civilizations: those who remained alone with themselves, those who fused with machines, those who left their bodies for the digital Spheres, and those who went out to the stars.
